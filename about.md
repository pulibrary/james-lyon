## HIS 521: History, Memory and Public History 

The original impetus for this project came from a graduate seminar taught by Professor Martha Sandweiss and Professor Anthony Grafton at the Department of History at Princeton University in the spring of 2017.  This course explored, among many other things, the methods, approaches, and challenges of public history. I would like to thank both Prof. Sandweiss and Prof. Grafton for their support with this project.
