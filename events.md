Early Music Princeton presents a concert of the oldest (and newest) examples of Princeton music-making and composition, featuring music and poetry written, performed, collected, or dance to by residents of Princeton and Nassau Hall in the mid- and late-1700s. Current PhD composer Ninfea Cruttwell-Reade will provide a thoughtful response to this music in a new composition.
